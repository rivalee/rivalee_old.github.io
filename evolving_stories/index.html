          <h1>evolving stories: notes and experiments</h1>

          <p>A hand-cranked, lazy notebook of sorts, designed to capture my thoughts about comics over the summer.</p>
          <h2>22 July 2018</h2>
          <h3>Settling on an idea</h3>
          <p>I'm going to start by exploring two ideas: grids and events happening within a single frame / scene. These feel small and self-contained, and have mileage to be developed into a series of drawings.</p>

        <h2>20 July 2018</h2>
        <h3>Context and background</h3>

          <p>A few months ago, <a href="http://rcottrell.com/dog_walk/">I looked at characters bound by narrative rules and asked artists to contribute a comic following those rules</a>. How else can rules be used in comics? <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">Conway's Game of Life</a> evolves based on an initial configuration. Comics are written and controlled by the author/artist, but there still could be something in a game-like approach to narrative storytelling.</p>

        <p>I'd like to explore a more experimental and potentially more abstract approach to sequential storytelling. I'm interested in time, rules, and minimalism. A couple of artists who have looked at this already, apart from Richard McGuire in <em>Here</em>: these are Nadine Redlich's <em>Ambient Comics</em> explore tiny moments in time: a train passing some mountains, the striking of a match, etc. They are basically sentences, rather than novels. </p>

        <p>Another artist experimenting with short moments is Marc-Antoine Mathieu, who managed to produce almost 70 pages from a time period of 3 seconds in <em>3"</em>.</p>

        <h3>Themes</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>The natural world, evolution</li>
          <li>Time and transition</li>
          <li>Minimalism</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Known limitations</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Silence: visual communication alone </li>
          <li>Short: poetry/paragraph length comics, rather than graphic novel length – each comic could be a unit  making up a larger whole, similar to an anthology or series </li>
          <li>Format will be a web comic</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Ideas</h3>

        <p>In no particular order / most of these ideas are about how form relates to storytelling</p>
        <ul>

          <li><b>grids</b></br>
          <em>i. Comics are stories sequenced through panels in a grid. Do grids need to be sequential?</br>
          ii. Grids are also ways to structure content: they support patterns and can show transition and change.  Could grids be an interesting way to show transitions and movement within a larger image?
        </em>
        </li></br>

        <li><b>events happening within a single frame / scene</b></br>
          The frame is like a stage in which different events occur.</br>
        <em>i. a window overlooking a scene, in which something small and new happens every day</em></br>
        <em>ii. a simple idea: overgrown: a garden slowly becomes overgrown over a period of time, falling into disrepair (and is discovered again?)</em></br>
        <em>iii. a more complex idea: every object in the scene has a story (mini-comic) attached to it</em></li>

        </br>

        <li><b>evolution</b></br>
        <em>i. takes place over millions of years: interesting time frame to experiment with and visualise </br>
          ii. a cross section of evolutionary history, a million years per panel, focusing on plant / animal life on earth</br>

    ii. extrapolate evolution: demonstrate it through imagery without doing a literal interpretation (like Conway's Game of Life)</em></li></br>

        <li><b>obfuscated super-minimalist storytelling</b></br>
          <em>i. what's the smallest possible unit for storytelling?</em>
        </br>
        <em>ii.  oblique and minimalist stories: abstracted, but still communicating the story of something. What's the most basic way to represent a character or a scene? </em>
        </br>    </br>

        </ul>
      </br>
