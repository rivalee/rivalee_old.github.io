# Fake meat
Fake meat makes people uncomfortable, challenges masculinity, and is the future.

## Fictional bones
A speculative design project which examined the purpose of bones in a post-meat future. These were a design provocation. What do we want to import into the new world of eating meat that doesn't come from animals? Could bones perform a nostalgic or functional role? Why would we want them at all?

## Fake meat: some design patterns
A book containing examples of fake meat, which was shrink-wrapped in plastic at a local butcher in Clapham. The books were sold at ASP4 at the ICA in December 2018.
