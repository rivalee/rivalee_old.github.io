An experimental comic collection created in 2018, featuring the work of 9 Royal College of Art artists. Riso printed by Hato Press.

The stories are created over six panels using the following rules:

2. A new smell is experienced by the dog in every comic.
3. Evert comic ends with a cliffhanger, which may or may not be resolved in the next comic.
