# Swatted: a minimalist tragicomedy

“Few creatures live in such close and intimate contact with human beings as flies”, writes Steven Connor. Swatted is a series of minimalist tragicomedies about a fly who dies in every story. Each story is 6 panels long. Narrative is driven by the conflict between the fly and the human spaces it inhabits. Romantic, poetic, and sensuous, the fly is a likeable and relentlessly optimistic character who ultimately loses the battle each time; yet despite the tragic outcome of each strip, the fly is alive again in the next story. Stories follow 8 rules for narrative and character, allowing a story to emerge within a defined structure.
