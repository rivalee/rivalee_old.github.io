<p><img src="images/ento_painting.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Rules shape behaviour and outcome. A gap between rules (the absence of a rule, something that is left undefined) is an opportunity for emergence. An emergent comic strip is a computational approach to authoring a story, where a human plays the role of a computer following a program.</p>

<p>An emergent comic strip uses rules to structure and partially define stories. In Swatted, each story has the same tragic outcome: the protagonist dies at some point in the six-frame story. An aspect of chance shapes the story: the length of the fly’s life, already very short over a maximum of six panels, is controlled by a dice roll. How the protagonist dies isn’t defined, and a different story emerges each time within the structure of the rules, and from within the spaces.</p>

<p>Character rules determine how the character responds to the world around it, drama comes from characters with strongly opposite goals. In this case, the conflict is between a fly and the human spaces it inhabits. The tragedy of the stories, in which the fly inevitably dies, is heightened by the joyful, optimistic, and likeable character of the fly.</p>
