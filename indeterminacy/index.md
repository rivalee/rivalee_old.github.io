# Narrative Indeterminacy

Narrative indeterminacy follows the principles of John Cage's musical indeterminacy, which is the ability of a piece to be played in different ways. This project is about using some limitations and rules – such as a story structure and basic plot – which can be interpreted by the artist in a number of different ways.

## Crossing the river
A comic strip about a bird-like monster who lives under a bridge. In every strip, the monster encounters someone (or something) trying to cross the bridge. The monster makes a judgment and decision, which drives a different outcome in the story. The first and last panels are the same.

[The shepherd](the-shepherd) -- The monster encounters a shepherd and makes a judgment.
