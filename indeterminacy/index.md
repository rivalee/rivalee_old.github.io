# Narrative Indeterminacy

Narrative indeterminacy follows the principles of John Cage's musical indeterminacy, which is the ability of a piece to be played in different ways. This project is about using some limitations and rules – such as a story structure and basic plot – which can be interpreted by the artist in a number of different ways.
