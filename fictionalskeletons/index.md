# Fictional Skeletons

Fictional Skeletons are a design provocation for the post-meat future. These are designs for the construction of faux meat. They could be used to skewer faux or lab-grown meat, or used at the production stage of growing cultured meat.

In a world where lab-grown meat is the norm, what kind of culinary design patterns and traditions do we want to import?
