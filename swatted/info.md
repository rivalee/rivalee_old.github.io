# Emergent narrative

Swatted is a comic about a fly who dies in every comic. It's an investigation into using rules to produce an emergent outcome.

## Rules

1. Six panel stories
2. The fly dies in every story
3. A roll of the 6-sided die determines the panel in which the fly dies
4. After the fly's death, events may still be occurring
5. The fly is always relentlessly optimistic despite the circumstances
6. The fly appears to be refined despite his true status
7. Often a second story is happening in the background
8. The primary voice is the fly, who speaks directly to the camera
