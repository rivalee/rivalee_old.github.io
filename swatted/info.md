# Emergent narrative

Swatted is a comic about a fly who dies in every comic. It's an investigation into using rules to produce an emergent outcome.

## Rules

1. Six panel stories
2. The fly dies in every story
3. A roll of the die determines the point at which the fly dies
4. The fly is always relentlessly optimistic despite the circumstances
5. The fly appears to be refined despite his true status
6. Often a second story is happening in the background
7. The primary voice is the fly, who always speaks directly to the camera
8. After the fly's death, there is silence, though events may still be occurring
