# Emergent narrative

Swatted is a comic about a fly who dies in every comic. It's an investigation into using rules to produce an emergent outcome.

## Rules

1. Six panels
2. The fly dies at the end of every comic
3. The fly is relentlessly optimistic despite the circumstances
4. The fly appears to be refined despite his true status
5. Often a second story is happening in the background
6. The primary voice is the fly, who always speaks directly to the camera
