# Some notes from the Royal College of Art, 30 May 2019

 Yesterday I had my final exam. I'm still processing everything I've learned in the last 2 years, but while it’s still fresh in my mind, here are some notes on my project. The ideas came from my interests in art, computers, and my dissertation (about the role gaps and spaces play in audience imagination). Shout-out to John Cage's [Indeterminacy project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indeterminacy_(music)) and David Lynch's comic, [The Angriest Dog in the World](http://www.lynchnet.com/angrydog/).

My main project is about a fly who dies in every comic. Every comic is six panels long.

## On Flies

When I first had the idea of a fly, a friend commented: "Why would anyone care about a fly dying?". Deciding to stick with it anyway, an RCA tutor later said that "all cartoon characters *ever* are based on an animal you wouldn't want inside your house". Mickey Mouse is one. I'm glad I picked a fly.

Flies are interesting because of how closely they live alongside humans. Human societies have attempted to rid themselves of flies and haven't been able to. In art, flies have been used to symbolise pleasure, decadence, a weakness for alcohol.

I designed my fly to look sweet and relatable. The fly's personality is romantic, poetic, sensuous, it just wants to befriend things and enjoy life. It's important that we care about the fly. Even though the fly dies in every single comic, it's somehow alive in the next story; there is an irreducible speck of optimism.

## Story physics

Story physics* is the idea that stories follow natural laws and have a natural, almost unavoidable structure to them.

I wrote 8 rules to define the plots, similar to [Chuck Jones's character rules](http://www.openculture.com/2015/03/chuck-jones-9-rules-for-drawing-road-runner-cartoons.html) for Wile E. Coyote and the Roadrunner from Looney Tunes ("The roadrunner cannot harm the coyote, except by going 'beep-beep!'", "All action must be confined to the natural environment of the two characters – the southwest American desert"). The rules define the character and guide the plot and structure, and leave plenty of things undefined. The space between the rules, what's left undefined, is an opportunity for emergence and imagination (see the bit on emergent design below).

An idea in story physics is to write characters with strongly opposite goals. The fly comics are about the conflict between what a fly wants (to be in human spaces, eat food belonging to humans) versus what a human wants (to live in a house without flies, to eat food uncontaminated by flies).

I've been heavily inspired by John Yorke's very good book 'Into the Woods' about story structure and why we tell stories. He argues that stories are a blueprint for survival. [This is an very good lecture he gave at Google](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P0UZHUnB5pQ).

The fly comics are also an experiment with using limitation. Each comic is only six panels long (two panels longer, actually, than is fashionable for online attention spans). It strongly relates to the work of the [Oubapo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oubapo) and [Oulipo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oulipo) groups — and if you don't know them, they're worth reading about.

## Emergent design

I've been obsessed with the idea of evolutionary, emergent and generative ideas in art for a while. My first introduction to this was [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life), a cellular automaton zero-player game.  Dawkins experimented with simulating evolution in his [biomorphs](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2093366-richard-dawkinss-biomorphs-come-back-to-life/) computer program back in the 1980s.

*Emergent design* is a term I use to describe art and stories that follows rules. I'm  interested in humans performing the work, rather than computers: so I'm putting 'computational thinking' into a different context. It's been difficult to find a clear definition of emergent design, so this is my personal definition, which is distinct from generative design. It sits within the bigger frame of systems art.

Sol LeWitt is an artist who also worked with rules: he's noted for his wall instructions, writing short specification for wall drawings which were carried out by another human:

 "The system is the work of art; the visual work of art is the proof of the system. The visual aspect can’t be understood without understanding the system. It isn’t what it looks like but what it is that is of basic importance."  [Here are some JavaScript implementations of Sol's rules.](http://solvingsol.com/solutions/)

## Where's the comics?

Come to [the Royal College of Art School of Communication show](https://www.rca.ac.uk/news-and-events/events/show-2019/), 29 June to 7 July.
