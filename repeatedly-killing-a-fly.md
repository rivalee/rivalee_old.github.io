# Repeatedly killing a fly

A series of 10x10cm risograph printed comics based on using rules to write a story. The comics are printed individually as origami books. The comics use a custom typeface I created.

It uses rules to structure the character and narrative, and ideas from story physics. Every story is about the conflict between a fly and the human spaces it inhabits.
