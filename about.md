# About



I'm a designer and illustrator living in London. I graduated from the RCA in 2019, specialising in illustration. I create experimental stories, aiming for a mood of absurdity which feels emotionally resonant, and also make paintings and drawings. I use my background working in technology to inspire mechanisms for creating experimental stories. 

I'm always interested in illustration commissions and collaborations. Get in touch!
