      <h2>A personal statement  </h2>
      <p>
  I don’t like the terms “hard of hearing” or “hearing impaired”. It sounds polite, and worse – it sounds so old!
</p>
<p>
  To myself I like to say my hearing is fucked. The word “fuck” still has some power in it: it’s a bit rude, it’s a bit angry. Saying it’s fucked, maybe, distinguishes me from a generation of elderly people for whom hearing loss is associated, whereas I’m young…ish, and angry.
  </p>
<p>
  Is there anything as deeply unsexy, deeply uncool as the words “hearing aid”? It summons images of beige, hideous, wired objects extruding from inside the ear. It’s gross how it goes inside the body! But it’s thanks to the magic and power of technology I can hear speech. I listen to music nearly all the time. Algorithms and technology improve over the years, and my ability to hear improves all the time: every so often I’m ‘upgraded’ and can hear more texture and more detail in my own voice, other people’s voices, and music. I’m incredibly lucky to have had my family support me in getting better, more expensive technology.
  </p>
<p>
  I’m lucky and privileged in other ways, too: I’m glad I’m healthy in virtually every other respect, and despite the difficulties I faced at school with my hearing (I went to hearing schools) I’m on the cusp of attaining my second master’s degree and I have a successful career as a designer in the technology industry. I’m proud of my achievements. Allow me this humblebrag.
  </p>
<p>
  With my “baseline” hearing, I can’t really distinguish speech. If I leave the shower or the hairdryer on, I can’t hear it; and I use the vibrating alarm on my iPhone to wake myself up in the morning.  At night, I hear muffled silence, which I’ve described before as like trying to hear underwater. It’s great for writing a dissertation when roadworks are happening outside. But that silence frightens me, because I know there are sounds; I just can’t detect them.
  </p>
<p>
  There’s no point in rage. But my faulty ears often make my life more difficult, more expensive, more painful, more embarrassing. I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t angry, didn’t often compare myself to others, and often wish I had ‘normal’ hearing. At the time of writing this I’m 32, I have the experience and wisdom and hindsight to process and understand problems I experienced in my youth. In the eyes of other people it doesn’t seem to be a big deal, but in my own eyes, thinking abstractly about myself, I often feel incomplete. Other times I forget about it; I feel happy and lucky and complete as anyone, I imagine, feels.
